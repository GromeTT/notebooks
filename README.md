Click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kwh40/notebooks/master) to run the notebooks using binder. Using the link you create your own binder session, in which you can modify the notebooks but you can't save your changes. If you leave the session, your changes will be lost. You can therefore experiment freely with the notebooks without being disturbed by others or disturbing others.

Binder is meant for interactive and ephemeral interactive coding, meaning that it is ideally suited for relatively short sessions. Binder will automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10 minutes of inactivity (if you leave your window open, this will be counted as “activity”).

Binder aims to provide at least 12 hours of session time per user session. Beyond that, we cannot guarantee that the session will remain running.
